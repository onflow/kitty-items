// and lists individual sales within that Storefront as Listings.
// There is one Storefront per account, it handles sales of all NFT types
// for that account.

// Each Listing can have one or more "cut"s of the sale price that
// goes to one or more addresses. Cuts can be used to pay listing fees
// or other considerations.
// Each NFT may be listed in one or more Listings, the validity of each
// Listing can easily be checked.
// 
// Purchasers can watch for Listing events and check the NFT type and
// ID to see if they wish to buy the listed item.
// Marketplaces and other aggregators can watch for Listing events
// and list items of interest.
