/*
    This is a simple KittyItems initial sale contract for the DApp to use
    in order to list and sell KittyItems.

    Its structure is neither what it would be if it was the simplest possible
    marjet contract or if it was a complete general purpose market contract.
    Rather it's the simplest possible version of a more general purpose
    market contract that indicates how that contract might function in
    broad strokes. This has been done so that integrating with this contract
    is a useful preparatory exercise for code that will integrate with the
    later more general purpose market contract.

    It allows:
    - Anyone to create Sale Offers and place them in a collection, making it
      publicly accessible.
    - Anyone to accept the offer and buy the item.

    It notably does not handle:
    - Multiple different sale NFT contracts.
    - Multiple different payment FT contracts.
    - Splitting sale payments to multiple recipients.
